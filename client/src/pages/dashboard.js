          <section className="sections" id="who-am-I">
            <h2>who am I?</h2>
  
              In simple terms I am creative mind, an artist , and web developer
              and someone strides for knowledge wisdom in a world full of
              darkness I accept the world for what it truly is a dark place I
              embrace darkness in a world of those who descend into the bright
              lies I believe in the dark acension! many might not be able to
              understand such a concept becuase most of us follow the status quo
              social constructs while i stray from the path its ok if you cant
              understand, thats what makes me a Raven in a world full of Doves!!

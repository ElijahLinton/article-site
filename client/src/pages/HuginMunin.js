      <h1>Denji</h1>
      <p>      The Chainsaw man manga has been a hell of an experiance throughout all my time
          reading manga and watching anime ive never luaghed at a manga like have
          denji is a hilarous character but also someone with humble beginnings
          and a rough life his dad commiting suicide
           or being killed by denji himself(according to makima) him being in debt
           and gaining a family just to lose it all
        </p>

      <h2>denjis love life</h2>
      <p>
        to think i had the worst love life....(lol)
        Denji makes all of ours look lik childs play
        i noticed that denjis love interest never felt the same way for him
        and even worse that had malicious intent for him reze simply was an assasain 
        who wanted his heart and him dead meanwhile denji wasnt interested with her at first
        but he fell in love with herand enjoyed her company but to be fair reze seemed 
        like she wanted to run off with denji so she wouldnt have to kill him but denji declined
        so she wasnt that messed up......but makima was a different story she didnt care about denji at all
        she was interested in the chainsaw man hero of hell she was a "fan of his" and tried to mentally 
        break him and controll him by giving him the facade of a family he never had and take it away pretty 
        heartbreaking situation man you got to feel bad for the guy he is a horny teenager yes but
        mostly some one who actually has a loving heart but whenever he tries to show it to others  
        it ends up almost caused downfall i think his love is his biggest strength but hes biggest witness
        he puts his trust in others way too easily and it cost him everytime especially his hesitation to cut losses
        and what i mean by that is accepting that others dont really "love" him like he loves them
        but hes young hes only 17 and hes never been shown love and affection hes only known a cold life of being
        used and abused hopefully his love life changes for the better.

          <h2>The Psychic Sisterhood</h2>

        <p>
      
          One character I felt I truly misunderstood was Tatsumaki, Mrs Tornado herself.
          Honestly I didn't like Tatsumaki as a person, I found her to be rude, childish, sassy as well cocky
          I hated the way she treated her sister. besides her being cute I really couldn't stand her personality
          But as I read the manga I started to understand her actions.Deep down inside she resonated with me, she didn't want to feel
          weak and useless as a child she was abandoned and left for dead by a scientist because she wasn't valuable
          then came along Blast. Blast was there for Tatsumaki when other wasn't her parents sold her off she never knew a loving home
          nor did she have a positive feminine figure in her life to give her warmth and compassion to treat her with care.
          She didn't have one because they sold her off for being non valuable, because all she's known in life is abandonment and unreliability at the hands of her parents
          who could she trust? Who could she rely on? She had no women figure to show her how love and no masculine figure to protect and provide with a sense of warmth
          and the first time she ever experienced that was from Blast who saved her and gave her a purpose in her life
          with lack of proper authority she walked around with a chip on her shoulder only one she had love for was her sister Fabuki.
          at first she came off as emotionally and mentally abusive towards Fabuki but as I read the manga it was simply tough love she wanted to protect her even if it ment being tough on her.
          he will to stand on her own feet and protect Fabuki made her arguebly the most powerful hero behind Saitama
